##Story
As a developer
I need to be able to
 -  process F1 driversâ€™ lap times to determine the average value for each drive and orders them to return the top three positions in ascending order

An example file is:

Alonzo,4.32
Verstrappen,4.75
Alonzo,4.88
Hamilton,4.65
Alonzo,4.38
Verstrappen,4.55
Hamilton,4.61
Hamilton,4.43
Verstrappen,4.59


##Implementation Approach

Broken down Application into 3 modules so that they can be used independently.
1. Extractor  - Reads csv and groups the data as per driver so that its ready to process
2. Transformer - calculated average and sorts as per lap time
3. Loader - writes  back results to a csv

Application file can be scheduled using a cron job or any scheduler

Alternative and more cleaner approach could have been to use spring batch , but since requirement was not to process record line by line
rather reading all in one go and process , it would require to write a custom reader.

Note : Logger shouyld have been added

##How to Run
File path can be provided in application properties and can be run as standard java application
